In addition to all source code and hardware designs, the project repository should include a README outlining
completed work, a description of the project’s architecture, and all known bugs. Failure to document bugs is
grounds for grade reduction.

## KeyScribe
### Project Description
KeyScribe is a tool for those who are interested in learning piano and would benefit from remote and real-time lessons. Its ability to connect wirelessly to another KeyScribe (keyboard/piano) enables interaction between a teacher and student where the keys being pressed would be transmitted to the other board. Additionally, its sheet music reading and writing functionalities serve as a bridge between the auditory and visual aspects of learning to improve a user’s understanding of music and allow them to compose their pieces.

| Breadboard setup      | Built the prototype for the keyboard/piano LED and push button circuits.                                                         |
| Raspberry Pi setup    | Set the Raspberry Pi as the client sending and receiving data to/from the server.                                                |
| Backend server setup  | Had the server handle the HTTP requests coming from the webpage and the WebSocket data from the Raspberry Pi.                    |
| Frontend setup        | Set up the login page for users being students or teachers. Set up a simple HTML webpage to interact with the keyboard prototype.|
